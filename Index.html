									I'm a Chalmers student studying my last year on the computer systems and networks master program at Chalmers. The bachelor I did before my master was the Software engeering program, but my interest for computers and programming started in high school when I selected to study at IT gymnasiet. During my time at IT gymnasiet I coded my first program and started to learn PHP and was buildning websites in my spare time. We did not learn advanced web design and development in school so most of the knowledge I had was things I learnt from internet and through experiments. I did one website for a friend (www.classicsaabracing.com) that was published but most projects was web designs I did for fun. Besides programming and computers I spend a lot of time with my family and my dog, going to the gym or playing video games.

									Leader of a group of seven people with the task to arrange activities for new students. Involved some hard decisions and I learnt how to set rules and structure to make the group work efficient. It is very important to have a conversation of the expectations and how the members work best to adapt to that. This was my first experience as a group leader and I really enjoyed the role. I’m a good listener and I feel that I managed to take everyone's needs into consideration to create an effective and functional group.
